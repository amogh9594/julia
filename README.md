# Julia 

Julia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language. While it is a general-purpose language and can be used to write any application, many of its features are well suited for numerical analysis and computational science.

Compared to Python, Julia is faster. However, Python developers are on a high note to make improvements to Python's speed. Some of the developments that can make Python faster are optimization tools, third-party JIT compilers, and external libraries.
